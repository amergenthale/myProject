# Reproducible Notebook

## Dataset Description
I am using a publicly available dataset: https://peerj.com/articles/17206/

This dataset contains analysis of twelve genomes of the bacterium Kerstersia gyiorum from brown-throated sloths (Bradypus variegatus), the first from a non-human host

The dataset was selected because it is relevant to evolutionary biology and allows downstream phylogenetic analyses without requiring raw sequencing data.

## Data Source
This dataset conatins 12 species, I am choosing 5 species and 3 genes from each. I will organize the data into Gene rpsJ, rplC, rplD. 

- Repository: myProject
- Organism(s): Sloths 

## Steps Taken
- Downloaded 5 gene data sets 
- Chose 3 genes to analyze
- Organized each gene into its own file
