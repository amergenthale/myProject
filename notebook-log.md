# Reproducible Notebook

## Dataset Description
I am using a publicly available dataset from Dryad:
https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.v27k6d0

This dataset contains phylogenomic data generated for sloth evolutionary analyses. 
The data consist of processed sequence data (Ultraconserved Elements, UCEs) that were previously assembled and used for phylogenetic reconstruction.

The dataset was selected because it is relevant to evolutionary biology and allows downstream phylogenetic analyses without requiring raw sequencing data.

## Data Source
This dataset does not include raw sequencing reads.

Instead, it contains processed UCE data that have already undergone quality control, assembly, and locus extraction by the original authors.

Because raw reads are not available, quality control steps such as FastQC were not performed.

- Repository: myProject
- Organism(s): Sloths 

## Steps Taken
- Downloaded dataset from Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.v27k6d0)
- Reviewed dataset contents and metadata
- Identified dataset stage as processed UCE loci
- No raw-read quality control performed due to lack of raw reads
- Notebook updated and pushed to GitHub
